# UFOs Analysis
  Analysis of UFO sightings.
  
## Overview of the analysis
Build a table using data stored in a JavaScript array. Then create filters to make this table fully dynamic, meaning that it will react to user input, and then place the table into an HTML file for easy viewing.
After that, customize a webpage using Bootstrap, and equip the table with several fully functional filters that will allow users to interact with our visualizations.
For the challenge, provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, we will add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.
The following outputs will be produced:

- Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria
- A written report on the UFO analysis
  
## Resources
- Data Source: data JavaScripy file
- Software: JavaScript, HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, VSCode

## Results
This page provides fully functional filters, using multiple criteria, that allows user's interaction as shown in the example below:

  - Initial Page
  
![initial](/initial.png)

   - Filtering by Shape = light
  
![f1](/f1_shape.png)
  
   - Adding filter by State = ca
  
![f2](/f2_state.png)

   - Adding filter by City = el cajon
  
![f3](/f3_city.png)

   - Adding filter by Date = 1/1/2010
  
![f4](/f4_date.png)
 
## Summary

One drawback of this design is that it requires the user to scroll over the whole list to select the input for the search criteria.  Another one is not being possible to reset filters (although we can select a new criteria for the filter),

As a recomendation for further dvelopments, I suggest the following:

  - Implementing combo boxes in the input fields, to show the possible selections and avpiding typos;
  
  - Implementing and option to reset filters, by "showing all" in the combo box suggested above.
